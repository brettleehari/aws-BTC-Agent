### 1. **test_goal_alignment.py** (580 lines)
45+ tests across 10 architectural goals

### 2. **.pre-commit-config.yaml**
Automated pre-commit hooks with linting, formatting, testing

### 3. **.git/hooks/pre-commit**
Git hook that runs automatically on commits

### 4. **Makefile** (24 commands)
Simplified test commands: `make test-goals`, `make test`, etc.

### 5. **.github/workflows/test.yml**
CI/CD pipeline with 6 jobs (goal tests, unit tests, integration, quality, docs, security)

### 6. **setup-dev-workflow.sh**
One-command developer environment setup

### 7. **docs/TESTING.md** (650+ lines)
Complete testing documentation with examples

### 8. **QUICKSTART_DEV.md**
Fast developer onboarding guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# One-time setup
./setup-dev-workflow.sh

# Run goal alignment tests
make test-goals

# Or directly
python tests/test_goal_alignment.py
```

## 🎯 10 Goals Tested

1. ✅ Autonomous decision-making
2. ✅ Cost optimization
3. ✅ Learning & adaptation
4. ✅ Real-time performance
5. ✅ Signal quality
6. ✅ Data source diversity
7. ✅ Clean architecture
8. ✅ Comprehensive testing
9. ✅ Documentation
10. ✅ Production readiness

## 🔄 Git Workflow

```bash
# Make changes
vim src/market_hunter_agent.py

# Commit (tests run automatically!)
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
# → Goal alignment tests run
# → Unit tests run
# → Security checks run
# ✓ Commit succeeds only if all pass

# Push (CI/CD runs on GitHub)
git push
```

## 📋 Available Commands

```bash
make test-goals       # Goal alignment tests ⭐
make test             # All tests
make test-fast        # Quick tests
