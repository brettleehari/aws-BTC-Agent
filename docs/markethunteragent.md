ðŸ¤– Autonomous Market Hunter Agent
Overview
The Autonomous Market Hunter is a truly agentic Bitcoin market intelligence system that operates independently every 10 minutes. Unlike traditional programmatic systems, this agent makes its own decisions about which data sources to query based on:

Current market conditions
Historical performance data
Learning from past results
Context-aware optimization
âœ… Key Agentic Features
1. Autonomous Decision-Making
The agent decides for itself which of the 8 data sources to query each cycle:

Available Sources:
â”œâ”€â”€ whaleMovements (On-chain large transactions)
â”œâ”€â”€ narrativeShifts (Social/trending themes)
â”œâ”€â”€ arbitrageOpportunities (Cross-exchange spreads)
â”œâ”€â”€ influencerSignals (Price action signals)
â”œâ”€â”€ technicalBreakouts (Chart patterns)
â”œâ”€â”€ institutionalFlows (Large holder movements)
â”œâ”€â”€ derivativesSignals (Funding rates, OI)
â””â”€â”€ macroSignals (Fear & Greed, market-wide)

Agent selects 3-6 sources per cycle based on:
âœ“ Market volatility (high/medium/low)
âœ“ Current trend (bullish/bearish/neutral)
âœ“ Trading volume
âœ“ Time of day (Asian/European/American/Overlap)
âœ“ Historical source performance
âœ“ Exploration vs exploitation balance
2. Context-Aware Strategy
The agent assesses market conditions and adapts:

Market Context Assessment:
â”œâ”€â”€ Volatility Detection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ High (>5% price change) â†’ Query 6 sources
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Medium (2-5%) â†’ Query 4 sources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Low (<2%) â†’ Query 3 sources
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Trend Analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Bullish â†’ Prioritize institutional flows, influencer signals
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Bearish â†’ Prioritize derivatives, whale movements
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Neutral â†’ Prioritize macro signals, narratives
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ Time-Based Optimization
    â”œâ”€â”€ Asian hours â†’ Whale movements +30% relevance
    â”œâ”€â”€ European hours â†’ Narrative shifts +30% relevance
    â”œâ”€â”€ American hours â†’ Institutional flows +30% relevance
    â””â”€â”€ Overlap â†’ Arbitrage opportunities +30% relevance
3. Adaptive Learning
The agent learns from every cycle:

Learning Metrics (per source):
â”œâ”€â”€ Success Rate: % of calls that return data
â”œâ”€â”€ Signal Quality: % that contribute to actionable signals
â”œâ”€â”€ Recency: Bonus for sources not used recently
â””â”€â”€ Context Relevance: Score based on current market

Learning Algorithm:
new_metric = (1 - learning_rate) Ã— old_metric + learning_rate Ã— new_observation

Default Learning Rate: 0.1 (10% weight to new data)
Exploration Rate: 0.2 (20% chance to try underused sources)
4. Inter-Agent Communication
When significant patterns emerge, the agent generates signals for other agents:

Signal Types:
â”œâ”€â”€ WHALE_ACTIVITY (severity: high)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Triggers: >100 BTC transactions detected
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ POSITIVE_NARRATIVE (severity: medium)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Triggers: 3+ bullish trending topics
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ INSTITUTIONAL_ACCUMULATION (severity: high)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Triggers: >$50B in institutional holdings
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ EXTREME_FUNDING (severity: critical)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Triggers: Funding rate >5% (liquidation risk)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ EXTREME_GREED (severity: medium)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Triggers: Fear & Greed Index >75
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ EXTREME_FEAR (severity: medium)
    â””â”€â”€ Triggers: Fear & Greed Index <25

Each signal includes:
âœ“ Severity level
âœ“ Confidence score
âœ“ Recommended action
âœ“ Target agents (bitcoin-orchestrator, risk-manager, etc.)
5. Self-Optimization
The agent continuously improves:

Exploration vs Exploitation: Balances trying new sources vs using proven ones
Dynamic Source Selection: Adjusts based on what's working
Context Learning: Remembers which sources work best in which conditions
Performance Tracking: Stores all decisions and outcomes for analysis


ðŸ“Š Decision-Making Example
Here's how the agent decides in a real scenario:


SCENARIO: High volatility bullish market during American hours

Step 1: Context Assessment
â”œâ”€â”€ BTC price: $62,500 (+4.2% in 24h)
â”œâ”€â”€ Volatility: HIGH (>5% change)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trend: BULLISH (strong upward)
â”œâ”€â”€ Volume: HIGH (120% of average)
â””â”€â”€ Time: American trading hours (13:00-21:00 UTC)

Step 2: Source Scoring
â”œâ”€â”€ derivativesSignals: 0.92 (high volatility +0.4, exploration +0.2)
â”œâ”€â”€ whaleMovements: 0.85 (high volatility +0.3, recency bonus +0.2)
â”œâ”€â”€ institutionalFlows: 0.83 (American hours +0.3, bullish +0.2)
â”œâ”€â”€ influencerSignals: 0.78 (bullish trend +0.4, quality 0.72)
â”œâ”€â”€ narrativeShifts: 0.72 (American hours +0.3, success 0.65)
â”œâ”€â”€ technicalBreakouts: 0.68 (medium relevance)
â”œâ”€â”€ macroSignals: 0.62 (always relevant baseline)
â””â”€â”€ arbitrageOpportunities: 0.55 (low relevance in trending market)

Step 3: Selection Decision
Agent selects TOP 6 sources (high volatility = more sources):
âœ“ derivativesSignals
âœ“ whaleMovements
âœ“ institutionalFlows
âœ“ influencerSignals
âœ“ narrativeShifts
âœ“ technicalBreakouts

Step 4: Query & Analyze
â”œâ”€â”€ Found: 2 whale transactions >100 BTC
â”œâ”€â”€ Found: 5 bullish narrative shifts
â”œâ”€â”€ Found: Extreme funding rate (0.06%)
â””â”€â”€ Generated: 3 signals for other agents

Step 5: Learning
â”œâ”€â”€ derivativesSignals: qualityâ†‘ (contributed to critical signal)
â”œâ”€â”€ whaleMovements: successâ†‘ (found actionable data)
â”œâ”€â”€ institutionalFlows: qualityâ†“ (no data returned)
â””â”€â”€ Updated metrics for next cycle


do the following.
 Meta-learning (learn optimal learning rate)
 Multi-objective optimization (accuracy vs cost)
 Causal inference (did my signals cause agent actions?)
 Collaborative filtering (learn from other agents' success)
 Anomaly detection (detect unusual patterns automatically)
 Natural language explanations (explain decisions in plain English)
