# Agent Memory System - Ready to Build! 🚀

## ✅ All Decisions Finalized

| Decision Point | Choice | Rationale |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| **Storage** | DynamoDB (no DAX for demo) | Cost-effective ($3.50/month vs $50/month) |
| **Scope** | Full system (STM + LTM + Analytics) | Complete feature set |
| **Multi-Agent** | From Day 1 | Future-proof architecture |
| **Memory Timeline** | < 1 day = STM, > 1 day = LTM | Clear separation |
| **Budget** | Demo/POC optimized | $3.50/month |
| **Patterns** | User will provide details | Will add to PATTERNS.md |

## 🏗️ What We're Building

### 1. Multi-Agent Memory System
```
Market Hunter ──┐
Risk Manager ───┼──→ Shared Memory Pool (DynamoDB)
Trade Executor ─┘
```

### 2. Hierarchical Memory
- **< 1 day**: Short-term (frequent access, auto-expire)
- **> 1 day**: Long-term (patterns, strategies, persistent)

### 3. Complete Decision Logging
Every decision logged with:
- Context (market conditions, agent state)
- Reasoning (why this decision was made)
- Outcome (what happened, success/failure)

### 4. Pattern Learning
Automatic identification of successful patterns:
- "Whale movements → price pump (78% confidence)"
- "High volatility + derivatives signals → trend reversal"
- User-defined patterns (you'll provide)

---

## 📊 DynamoDB Tables (4 Tables)

1. **`agent_decisions`**: All decisions from all agents
2. **`agent_memory_ltm`**: Long-term patterns and strategies
3. **`agent_state`**: Current agent state and configuration
4. **`agent_signals`**: Cross-agent communication

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Right Now:
1. **Start Phase 1**: Create models and AWS clients
2. **Get API keys ready**: AWS credentials configured
3. **Local testing**: DynamoDB Local for development

### Questions for You:
1. **Agent Priority**: Start with Market Hunter memory integration?
2. **AWS Account**: Do you have AWS credentials configured?
3. **Pattern Details**: When will you provide specific patterns to learn?

## 🤔 Do You Want to Start?

**Option A**: I can start implementing Phase 1 right now
- Create models.py with all schemas
- Create aws_clients.py
- Create basic MemoryManager

**Option B**: Wait for more pattern details from you first
- You provide specific patterns
- We incorporate them into the design
- Then start building

**Option C**: Just review the plan, start later
- Review all documentation
- Ask questions
- Start when ready

**Which option would you like?** Let me know and we'll proceed! 🚀
