   - Error handling exists
   - Logging implemented

8. ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests present (5+ files)
   - Integration tests exist
   - Evaluation framework implemented

9. ✅ **Documentation**
   - README comprehensive (>1000 chars)
   - Architecture documented in docs/
   - Docstrings in main classes

10. ✅ **Production Readiness**
    - Environment variables used
    - Deployment scripts exist
    - requirements.txt present
    - CI/CD configured

## 🔄 Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes
vim src/market_hunter_agent.py

# 2. Format code
make format

# 3. Test goal alignment
make test-goals

# 4. Run fast tests
make test-fast

# 5. Commit (hooks run automatically!)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: improve source selection"

# Pre-commit hooks automatically run:
# → Goal alignment tests
# → Fast unit tests
# → Syntax check
# → Security scan
# ✓ Commit only if all pass!

# 6. Push (CI/CD runs on GitHub)
git push
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Tests fail with "Module not found"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Pre-commit hook not running
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Want to skip hooks (not recommended)
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP"
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **Quick Start**: `QUICKSTART_DEV.md`
- **Full Testing Guide**: `docs/TESTING.md`
- **Test Suite Details**: `tests/README.md`
- **Deployment**: `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **All Commands**: Run `make help`

## 💡 Key Benefits

1. **Prevents Architecture Drift** - Tests catch when code diverges from design
2. **Fast Feedback** - Know immediately if changes break goals
3. **Automatic Validation** - No manual testing needed
4. **Living Documentation** - Tests document expected behavior
5. **Onboarding Tool** - New devs learn architecture from tests

## 🎯 Example: What Gets Caught

### ❌ This Would Fail Goal Alignment Tests:

```python
# Hardcoded source selection
def select_sources():
    return ["whale_movements", "narrative_shifts"]

# Always expensive model
llm = BedrockClient(model="claude-3-opus")

# Static weights
whale_weight = 0.8  # Never changes
```

### ✅ This Would Pass:

```python
# Dynamic selection based on context
def select_sources(context):
    scores = self.calculate_scores(context)
    return self.top_k_with_exploration(scores)

# Task-based routing
llm = router.select_model(task_type, complexity)

# Learning algorithm
new_weight = (1 - alpha) * old + alpha * observed
```

## 🚨 When to Run Tests

### Always (Automatic):
- **On every commit** - Pre-commit hooks run automatically
- **On every push** - GitHub Actions CI/CD runs

### On Demand:
- **Before starting work**: `make test-goals`
- **During development**: `make test-fast`
- **Before code review**: `make check`
- **After major changes**: `make test`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your testing framework is working when:
- ✅ Tests run automatically on `git commit`
- ✅ Bad code patterns are caught before commit
- ✅ CI/CD shows green checkmarks on GitHub
- ✅ Developers get fast, clear feedback
- ✅ Architecture stays aligned with goals

## 📞 Support

- Run `make help` for all commands
- Read `docs/TESTING.md` for full guide
- Check `tests/README.md` for test details
- Review `QUICKSTART_DEV.md` for quick start

---

## 🎊 Summary

You now have:
- ✅ **45+ goal alignment tests** validating architecture
- ✅ **Automatic git hooks** preventing bad commits
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline** on GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Simple commands** via Makefile
- ✅ **Comprehensive docs** for guidance

**Next step**: Run `make test-goals` to verify everything works! 🚀
